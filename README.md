## Introduction

Experience the thrill and strategic challenge of the Hunger Games with this text-based Python simulation game. Step into the shoes of a tribute, make critical survival decisions, and navigate the complexities of the arena.

## Project Context

This simulation game was created as part of my coursework in Business Analysis at Hult International Business School. It's designed to blend analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, providing a hands-on experience in strategic decision-making through programming.

## Game Overview

This game immerses players in the life of a Hunger Games tribute. Using Python, players respond to text-based prompts to make decisions that directly influence their survival. Each choice can lead to different scenarios and outcomes, enhancing the game's replayability.

## Key Features

### Initial Setup

At the start of the game, players are initialized with specific attributes such as health, strength, and intelligence that influence their performance throughout the game.

```python
def initialize_player(health, strength, intelligence):
    return {
        'health': health,
        'strength': strength,
        'intelligence': intelligence,
        'inventory': []
    }
```
*Initializes the player with health, strength, intelligence, and an empty inventory.*

### Decision Making

Players choose their actions, each affecting their survival odds. Hereâ€™s how players can interact with the game:

```python
def choose_action(player):
    print("Choose your action:")
    print("1. Search for food")
    print("2. Hunt")
    print("3. Hide")
    action = input("> ")
    if action == '1':
        search_for_food(player)
    elif action == '2':
        hunt(player)
    elif action == '3':
        hide(player)
    else:
        print("Invalid action")
        choose_action(player)
```
*Prompts player to choose an action and processes the input.*

### Game Dynamics

The game's mechanics include managing resources, maintaining health, and making strategic decisions to survive each day in the arena.
